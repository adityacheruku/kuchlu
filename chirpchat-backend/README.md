# Kuchlu Backend: In-Depth Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive technical guide to the Kuchlu backend API. It covers the architecture, core systems, and a detailed reference for every API endpoint.

## 1. Technical Architecture

The backend is a high-performance API built with Python and FastAPI, designed for real-time communication and scalability.

*   **Framework**: FastAPI for building robust, high-performance APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation.
*   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) is used for data persistence. The backend communicates with it using the `supabase-py` client library. All data definition and management (DDL) is handled via SQL scripts in the `supabase/` directory.
*   **Real-Time & Scaling**: Redis is used as a message broker for a Pub/Sub system. This allows multiple, stateless backend instances to broadcast real-time events (like new messages or presence updates) to all connected clients, ensuring scalability.
*   **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with short-lived `access_token`s and long-lived `refresh_token`s for persistent sessions.
*   **File Storage**: Cloudinary is used for storing all user-uploaded media (avatars, images, documents, voice messages).
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: The entire backend is asynchronous (`async`/`await`) to handle high concurrency efficiently.

## 2. Core Systems Explained

### 2.1. Authentication Flow

The authentication system is designed for security and persistence.

1.  **Registration (`POST /auth/register`)**:
    *   A new user provides a phone number, password, and display name.
    *   The password is securely hashed using `bcrypt`.
    *   A new user record is created in the `users` table.

2.  **Login (`POST /auth/login`)**:
    *   The user provides their phone number and password.
    *   The server verifies the password against the stored hash.

3.  **Token Issuance**:
    *   Upon successful registration or login, the backend generates two JSON Web Tokens (JWTs):
        *   **`access_token`**: A short-lived token (e.g., 30 minutes) required to access protected API endpoints. It is sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
        *   **`refresh_token`**: A long-lived token (e.g., 7 days) used *only* to get a new `access_token`.

4.  **Token Refresh (`POST /auth/refresh`)**:
    *   When the `access_token` expires, the frontend sends the `refresh_token` to this endpoint.
    *   If the `refresh_token` is valid, the backend issues a *new* pair of access and refresh tokens. This is known as **token rotation** and enhances security.

5.  **Logout**:
    *   Logout is handled on the client-side by simply deleting the stored tokens. The server-side tokens will naturally expire.

### 2.2. Real-Time Event System

The real-time system is the heart of the application, designed for resilience and low latency.

1.  **Primary Connection (WebSocket - `/ws/connect`)**:
    *   The frontend first attempts to establish a WebSocket connection. This provides a low-latency, bidirectional communication channel for sending and receiving events instantly.
    *   Authentication is performed via a token in the query parameter (`?token=...`).

2.  **Fallback Connection (Server-Sent Events - `/events/subscribe`)**:
    *   If the WebSocket connection fails (e.g., due to a restrictive network proxy), the frontend automatically falls back to an SSE connection.
    *   SSE is a read-only channel where the server pushes events to the client.
    *   Actions from the client (like sending a message) are sent over standard HTTP POST requests to the API, which then broadcasts them to the recipient via Redis.

3.  **Event Broadcasting (Redis Pub/Sub)**:
    *   This is the key to scalability. When an event occurs (e.g., User A sends a message), the API instance that receives the request publishes the event to a central Redis channel.
    *   All other API instances are subscribed to this channel. They receive the event and forward it to their connected clients (either via WebSocket or SSE).

4.  **Event Sequencing & Sync (`GET /events/sync`)**:
    *   Every event broadcast through Redis is assigned a unique, sequential ID from a Redis counter. This sequence number is included in the event payload sent to the client.
    *   The client stores the `sequence` number of the last event it processed.
    *   If the client disconnects and reconnects, it calls `/events/sync?since=<last_sequence_id>`. The backend then fetches all events that have occurred since that number from a temporary event log (also in Redis) and sends them to the client, ensuring no messages are ever missed.

## 3. API Endpoint Reference

This section details every major API endpoint, its purpose, request format, and expected response.

### Auth Router (`/auth`)

#### `POST /register`
*   **Action**: Creates a new user account.
*   **Request Body**: `UserCreate` schema (`{ phone, password, display_name, email? }`)
*   **Success Response (200 OK)**: `Token` schema (`{ access_token, refresh_token, token_type, user: UserPublic }`)
*   **Error Responses**:
    *   **400 Bad Request**: If the phone number is already registered or validation fails.
    *   **500 Internal Server Error**: If the database operation fails.

#### `POST /login`
*   **Action**: Authenticates a user and issues tokens.
*   **Request Body**: `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` (`{ username: phone, password }`)
*   **Success Response (200 OK)**: `Token` schema.
*   **Error Responses**:
    *   **401 Unauthorized**: If credentials are incorrect.

#### `POST /refresh`
*   **Action**: Issues a new `access_token` using a valid `refresh_token`.
*   **Request Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <refresh_token>`
*   **Success Response (200 OK)**: `Token` schema with a new `access_token` and a new `refresh_token`.
